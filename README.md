# JBioFramework Web Application
> The JBioFramework Web Application is a more efficient method of performing 1-Dimensional
> through the use of a browser and file selection in the format of 
> FASTA files. This document will contain information regarding [Download and Installation](#download-and-installation), 
> [Usage for Development](#usage-for-development), and [Testing Usage](#testing-usage) for the application.

## Project Sponsor
- [Dr. Paul Craig](mailto:pac8612@rit.edu)

<img src="frontend/jbio-app/src/assets/profiles/Paul_Craig.jpg" alt="Paul Craig" width="200"/>

Dr. Paul Craig received his B.S. in Chemistry from Oral Roberts University in 1979, and his Ph.D. in Biological Chemistry from The University of Michigan in 1985. Following a post-doc at Henry Ford Hospital (biophysical chemistry of blood clotting; 1985-1988), he spent five years as an analytical biochemistry at BioQuant, Inc., in Ann Arbor, Michigan before joining RIT in 1993.
## Download and Installation:
### Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulcraig/ProSep
```

#### VSCode

This repository contains a python 3.12 slim image. Ensure you have installed the dev containers extension,
open the command palette, and either build the container or rebuild it.

#### Manual without image

```bash
cd ProSep
```

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows may have python set to be under `py` instead of `python`. If this is the case, simply
replace all calls to `python` with `py`.

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js 20.11.0 or higher
- React 18.2.0 or higher

## Usage for Development
Navigate to the top level directory by typing in the command line 

```bash
cd ProSep
```
<br/>

Launch the API server by typing in the command line:
```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

Navigate to the jbio-app subdirectory by typing in the command line 

```bash
cd frontend/jbio-app
```

Then install the npm files

```bash
npm install
```

<br/>

Launch the application by typing in the command line:
```bash
npm start
```

A browser will open with the URL: http://localhost:3000/

Press the **`1D Electrophoresis`** button on the left.

Follow the instructions listed beneath the simulation to load the desired FASTA files and begin the simulation:

## Tagging Policy

The server picks up changes via semantic versioning. As such, all tags must come
from the main branch and be tagged semantically.

For example: `v1.1.1` -> `v1.1.2`

## Testing Usage

### Backend Guide:
#### Author: Mack Leonard

Navigate to the top level directory by typing in the command line

```bash
cd ProSep
```

Then execute a test with

```bash
python -m unittest backend.Electro1DTests.ProteinTest
```

OR

Some IDEs have a built-in run function for files that can be executed. If you wish to do this, navigate to the ProteinTest.py or any other test file and click the run button.

<br/>

Analyze results from the tests being run and modify the test or method being tested if failed.
